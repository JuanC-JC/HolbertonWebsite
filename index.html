            <h2>Where does the word algorithm come from?</h2>
            <p>The origin of the word algorithm is under discussion. According to the Real Academia Española, for example,
                 <strong> it comes from the Latin algobarismus</strong> , which would be an abbreviation of the classic Arabic
                  <strong>ḥisābu lḡubār</strong>,which would mean<strong> 'calculation by means of Arabic figures'.
                </strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, there is a theory that the word algorithm is<strong>derived from the Latinization of al-Jwārizmī
                </strong>, the name of a mathematician of Persian origin, the father of algebra, who lived between the 
                7th and 8th centuries.
            </p>

            <p>The alteration of this word, in addition, would have been produced by to the influence of the friego arithmós that 
                means 'number' and of the Castilian logarithm.
            </p>
            
            <!-- links para palabras claves como problema o decision -->
            <h3>But… ¿What's an algorithm?</h3>
            <p>
                These are ordered and finite sets of steps, which allow us to solve a problem or make a decision.
            </p>


            <h2>Parts of an algorithm</h2>
            
            <p>Any algorithm must consist of the following parts:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> Entry of the data that the algorithm needs to operate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>This is the formal logic operation that the algorithm will undertake with the input received</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong>The results obtained from the process on the input, once the execution of the algorithm is finished.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3></h3>

            <h2>Types of algorithms</h2>

            <p>There are four types of algorithms in computing
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Computational Algorithms:</strong>An algorithm whose resolution depends on the calculation, and that can be developed by a calculator 
                        or computer without difficulty.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Non-computational algorithms:</strong>Those that do not require the processes 
                        of a computer to be solved, or whose steps are exclusive to resolution by a human 
                        being.

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Qualitative algorithms:</strong>It's an algorithm in whose resolution do 
                        not involve numerical calculations, but logical and / or formal sequences.

                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Quantitative algorithms:</strong>On the contrary, it's an algorithm that 
                        depends on mathematical calculations to find its resolution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>What's the importance of an algorithm?</h2>

            <p>Simply put, an algorithm allows us<strong>to solve a problem step by step</strong>
               by contemplating the possible errors that may arise in its development. It’s a series 
               of instructions ordered and sequenced to guide a given process.
            </p>

            <h2>Algorithm characteristics</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="./Images/img_caracteristicas.jpg" alt="" class="img-intro">
                <figcaption class="img-description">An algorithm must provide a result based on its functions.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
                The algorithms have the following characteristics:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sequential:</strong>they operate in sequence, they must be processed one at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precise:</strong>they can’t be ambiguous or subjective, they must be objective in solving the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Orderly:</strong>they must be established in the precise and exact sequence so that their reading makes sense and the problem is solved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Finite:</strong>it must have a determined end, it cannot be prolonged to infinity, that is why it must have a determined number of steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> must show a result to the problem solved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defined:</strong>a same algorithm with the same elements of entrance should give always the same results.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <!-- links para palabras claves como computacion -->
            <p>In computer science, however, the algorithms are the skeleton of the processes that 
                are then coded and programmed to be performed by the computer.
            </p>
            
            <!-- colocar imagen del area de un cuadrado -->
            <h2>Example</h2>

            <p>A very simple example of an algorithm is the calculation of the area of a right triangle:

                <ol>
                    <li>Find the base (B) and height (A) measurements of the triangle.</li>
                    <li>Multiply (B x A).</li>
                    <li>Divide the result of the multiplication by two (B x A)/2.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>As you can see, all your life you have used the algorithms, from the simplest activity of your day to day 
                can be established as an algorithm, or as you would say a "routine".
            </p>
